# Scaler-Clustering-Model

# Project Overview: 
Scaler, an online tech-versity, aims to enhance the skills of software professionals through its intensive computer science and data science courses. As a data scientist with the analytics vertical of Scaler, this project focuses on profiling the best companies and job positions to work for from the Scaler database.

# Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to cluster learners based on their job profile, company, and other relevant features to identify ideal career paths.

# Dataset: 
The project will utilize a segment of learner information from the Scaler database, including job profiles, companies, and other features.

# Methodology: 
The project will employ clustering algorithms to group learners with similar characteristics. The approach will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to identify the most suitable clustering technique.

# Deliverables: 
The project will deliver a clustering model that categorizes learners into distinct groups based on their job profiles, companies, and other features. The model will provide insights into the characteristics of each cluster, enabling Scaler to identify ideal career paths for its learners.
